# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
### Overview of the analysis.
The purpose of this analysis was to look into the employee outlook of a company and to see whether their workforce could be protected from a mass of future retirements.
### Results.
The four major takeaways from the research into Pewlett-Hackard are as follows:
1. The fact that there were duplicates in the 'retirement_titles' data slightly altered the results to make it seem like there were more retirement-age employees than was actually the case. 
2. The 'retiring_titles' dataset provides the most accurate measurement of the retiring workforce because it deals in numerical counts of the workforce. 
3. The number of employees who are eligible for the Mentorship program is significantly less than those who are eligible for retirement. 
4. The vast majority of those retiring have entered into senior positions with the company before leaving. 
### Summary
1. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? Based on the sum of the positions held in the 'retiring_titles' dataset there are approximately 75,000 openings that will need to be filled as the positions become vacant. 
2. Are there enough qualififed, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? Based on the 'mentorship_eligibility' dataset there are 1,550 employees who can mentor the next generation of employees, which is much behind the approximately 75,000 openings that will have to be occupied once the retirement-ready population leaves.
